# Final Project
## Part I: The Idea
### Outline
#### Summary
While industrial revolution originated in the UK in the 18th to 19th century, the rest of Europe were able to follow UK's footsteps due to the increasing interconnectedness between the countries. However, the spread of the revolution stopped within Europe and western offshoots, causing the Great Divergence between the industrialised countries and the rest of the world. 

#### Plotpoints
1. Malthusian Poverty Trap.
2. UK's Industrial Revolution: Rise of UK GDP and standards of living.
3. Spread to Europe: The rising interconnectedness of the whole of Europe correlates with mainland European countries' catching up with UK in terms of economic activities. Example: development of the railroad system. 
4. The Great Divergence: The rest of the world lagged behind while Europe and western offshoots quickly developed, leading to the world inequality today. 
5. Call to action: Stand against deglobalisation, support free flow of human and physical capital across national borders.

### Data
#### Maddision Project
[Statistics on World Population, GDP and Per Capita GDP, 1-2008 AD](http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/oriindex.htm)

> "The Maddison Project, also known as the Maddison Historical Statistics Project, is a project to collate historical economic statistics, such as GDP, GDP per capita, and labor productivity. It was launched in March 2010 to continue the work of the late economic historian Angus Maddison. The project is under the Groningen Growth and Development Centre at the University of Groningen, which also hosts the Penn World Table, another economic statistics project." - [Wikipedia: Maddison Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maddison_Project)

This is my main source of data. The Maddison dataset is a very popular and well-respected dataset in developmental economics. I will use the raw dataset to visualise:
- World GDP per capita 1-2008 AD (by calculating world average GDP per capita in a given year)
- UK's industrial revolution (by graphing UK's GDP per capita across time)
- Industrial revolution in Europe (by graphing GDP per capita in selected European countries around the time of the industrial revolutions, including UK)
- The Great Divergence (by graphing GDP per capital in selected countries around the world during and after the industrial revolutions, including UK)

#### Fordham University's Internet Modern History Sourcebook

> "The Internet Modern History Sourcebook is one of series of history primary sourcebooks. It is intended to serve the needs of teachers and students in college survey courses in modern European history and American history, as well as in  modern Western Civilization and World Cultures. Although this part of the Internet History Sourcebooks Project began as a way to access texts that were already available on the Internet, it now contains hundreds of texts made available locally." - [Paul Halsall: Introduction, Internet Modern History Sourcebook](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/modsbook.asp#Introduction)

[Tables Illustrating the Spread of Industrialization](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/indrevtabs1.asp)

[Spread of Railways in 19th Century](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/INDREV6.asp)

I will use the railroad information in the table (linked above) to visualise:
- The interconnectidedness of Europe across the period during industrial revolutions. The spread of railway in a country should positively correlates with its stage in industrial revolution as well as GDP per capita.

3. [Progress and Poverty in Early Modern Europe](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3698570?seq=1)

Allen, R. (2003). Progress and poverty in early modern Europe. The Economic History Review, 56(3), pp.403-443.

These economics essays will give me a framwork for my story of the industrial revolutions and the great divergence. The empirical data, analysis of the economic history, and the economics theory will go into the write up of my project. Some of the numbers reported or calculated in the essays might be used in smaller/simpler visualisations to support the story arc. I will decide which data to visualise as I move forward in this project. 

### Method and Medium
I will use Shorthand. The final project will be a story with both description and data visualisation intertwined with each other presented as a digital story that can be accessed online. This style might be similar to Delloite's [Balancing the Books:
IFRS 16 and Aviation Finance](http://www.euromoneythoughtleadership.com/aviation-IFRS16/). The style of writing will be similar to an eocnomics essay, but I'm hoping the visualisations will be much better than my past essays ;)

## Part II: Design and User Research
### Wirefames / storyboard for user feedback
![New Wireframe 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60046385/74597875-80f0af00-5034-11ea-8725-4c5f09886110.png)

### Creation of a user research protocol and completion of interviews

1. Identifying representative individuals to interview

Since I am an international student myself, I know a fair amount of international students with various backgrounds. I have selected three of my friends who are close enough to give me honest feedback. The three participants have the following academic and geographical backgrounds:

- Master Student, Design, School of Visual Arts, New York, US

- Master Student, Information System Management, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, US

- Master Student, Chemistry, Durham University, Durham, UK

The design student can give me perspectives on visual aspects, the chemistry student can give me perspectives on data analytics, and the MISM student is also in the Telling Stories with Data class, so we can talk about the specifics of data visualisation covered in this class. The interviews are conducted in Mandarin and/or English. 

2. Interview script

The questions I prepared are:

- Have a quick glance through the article. What is the story I'm trying to tell? Please retell it to me.

- Now please look at each of the data visualisations. What do you think I am trying to accomplish with those graphs? Are any of them confusing to you?

I will tell them the story I am planning to tell in this article, and what each data visualisation is for. 

- How do you suggest that I can improve? 

Generally I haven't planned a lot of questions beforehand, but rather relying on going deeper on their feedbacks as well as bouncing new ideas of them. 

3. Findings from interviews

- Master Student, Design, XXX, New York, US

In general she liked the wireframe. According to her, the central idea was relatively clear. For the first graph, the only thing she didn't understand is why the three segments are fragmented. (It was due to the lack of data pre 1850 and Tableau's grouping function when I tried to change the color of the segments.) 

However, she didn't like the last visualisation "The Great Divergence". There were too many colors in one graph and she wasn't sure what I wanted to say with this graph. She suggested that I grouped the countried into "Western Europe and Western Offshoots" and "The Rest of the World", since the former one rode the wave of the industrial revolution and the second group missed out, and these are the two groups I was trying to compare. 

Furthermore, she suggested that I use a realistic and simple aesthetic. Economics doesn't need flashy colors of graphics. My topic is also quite a serious one. In generaly, she suggested a theme of blue for my article. For the accompanying pictures, she suggested historical photos and minimal use of animated images. 

- Master Student, Information System Management, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, US

As a fellow student in the Telling Stories with Data class, her suggestion was more technically focused. For the first visualisation, she felt that the World GDP isn't needed. The current graph is misleading as World GDP and UK GDP have the same shape but are not on the same scale (UK GDP is way higher than world average). 

For the second visualisation, she suggested I use a short animation to show the changes across time. Shorthand offers a functions to scroll across image, which could be used to do the animation. The current design is a bit confusing because the graph is too long to fit in the computer screen, so when she scrolled down she couldn't see the top of the graph. But overall she was impressed by this visualisation. 

The third visualisation remains to be a problem. There were too many colours. She suggested to use more grouping, less colour, and duller colours as opposed to brighter ones. She also felt that the ending was too abrupt, and that I should have a summary. 

- Master Student, Chemistry, Durham University, Durham, UK

As a chemistry student, she mainly focused on the internal logic of my article and the truthful representation of data. She also felt that world GDP isn't needed, because it doesn't fit in with the arc of the story. We agreed that the structure of the story should be UK-Europe-World, which is increasing in scope. 

For the second graph, she felt that it was fine once she spent sometime reading it. But at first she didn't know where to too at and in which direction she should process (e.g. should I read horizontally first or vertically first?). She felt that more instruction should be provided in reading this graph. 

She was simiarlly confused about the third graph. Comments made were similar to the ones described above. Overall, their confusion about this visualisation surprised me, because I have an economics background and I know this is a very well known visualisation of the Great Divergence, which is also a famous viewpoint in economics. I kind of forgot not all people have the same background as I do, and that they are not familiar with the concept itself. 

4. Changes implemented

After careful consideration, I implemented these changes:

- Changed the main title of the article to make my overall story structure and main viewpoint clearer. 

- Added opening photo slide show to draw people in.

- Deleted the World GDP visualisation. 

- Indicated spaces for images. 

- Divided story by chapters to indicate logical flow. 

- Redo the GDP & Rail & Import Export graph as an animation. (The animation is indicated here by a video frame, but I am planning to use animation while scrolling on Shorthand, which will be a full screen animation).

- Added two correlation coefficients between GDP per capita & Railway Milage and GDP per capita & International Trade per capita. 

- Divided countries into two subgroups for the Great Divergene graph to reduce the colours.

- Changed the title of the Great Divergence graph to better suggest the main idea of the data visualisation. 

- Added another animation (same style as the one before) to reinforce the increasing global inequality as a result of the Great Divergence. 

- Changed the last part of the story to a summary. Added a word cloud to indicate the importance of Glibalisation & Deglibalisation and that people are putting more and more focus on the topic. 

- Added "share" button as a clear call to action. 

### Revised wireframes / visualizations / storyboards based on what you heard
![Revised](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60046385/74611938-a16d4780-50ce-11ea-838b-04e94b9894d7.png)


## Part III: Final Data Dtory
[An Open World: A Case Study of Industrial Revolution in Europe and the Importance of Openness](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/an-open-world/index.html)

Any intellectual with an interest in global economy or global politics. Because of the limitation of this project, I am choosing to target international students in universities especially. They are a typical subgroup of my broader target audience. They are more likely to care about globalisation and the free flow of capital across national borders. This project gives them some theoretical and empirical backing, encouraging them to embrace their roles as bridges across countries and support freedom of movement. 

When creating the moodboard, I wanted something that is serious but still colourful. I decided to do black/white/grey/blue as the theme. This is the colour scheme of The Economist, and I feel that my targey audience should be comfortable about the overall feel of the article. 

As for the article itself, I kept in mind that my target audiences are intelligent, but not nessecarily have a background in economics. Therefore I reused some of my old lecture notes on developmental economics and economic history, but also cut down the economic theory and focused more on the story of the industrial revolution itself. Still, I feel that comparing to many other online articles about the industrial revolution or globalisation, my article is more academic and presents more detailed arguments, which I am quite happy about. 

At the same time, the data visualisation and the overall design of the article is way more stylish than the traditional economics journals. For starters, academic papers in economics are usually in black and white, so I am very happy about the way that I introduced images and colours into a very serious topic. Secondly, economists loves bar charts, line charts, and scatterplots. I have two line charts in the article, but they look intentionally designed and aesthetically pleasing. But I also have a group of three heat maps to showcase the correlation between economic growth and economic openness. This is something I never would have chosen for an economics story had I never taken the Telling Stories with Data class. Yes the correlation can simply be represented by correlation coefficients, but the visualisation just conveys my viewpoint more direcly and more accessable for people without a statistics background. 

This class expanded my knowlegde of the types of data visualisations available. The other one is Tableau. I used to only Excel for visualisations, which is fine when I'm only doing bar charts or line charts. Now that I have more variety in data visualisation, Tableau is a very powerful tool to visualise what I have in mind. Plus since I want to pursue a career in market research, it will come in handy when I start my internship.
