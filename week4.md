# Week 4 Assignment: Final Project Part I

## Outline
### Summary
While industrial revolution originated in the UK in the 18th to 19th century, the rest of Europe were able to follow UK's footsteps due to the increasing interconnectedness between the countries. However, the spread of the revolution stopped within Europe and western offshoots, causing the Great Divergence between the industrialised countries and the rest of the world. 

### Plotpoints
1. Malthusian Poverty Trap.
2. UK's Industrial Revolution: Rise of UK GDP and standards of living.
3. Spread to Europe: The rising interconnectedness of the whole of Europe correlates with mainland European countries' catching up with UK in terms of economic activities. Example: development of the railroad system. 
4. The Great Divergence: The rest of the world lagged behind while Europe and western offshoots quickly developed, leading to the world inequality today. 
5. Call to action: Stand against deglobalisation, support free flow of human and physical capital across national borders.
