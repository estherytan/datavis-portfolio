# Week 4 Assignment: Final Project Part I

## Outline
### Summary
While industrial revolution originated in the UK in the 18th to 19th century, the rest of Europe were able to follow UK's footsteps due to the increasing interconnectedness between the countries. However, the spread of the revolution stopped within Europe and western offshoots, causing the Great Divergence between the industrialised countries and the rest of the world. 

### Plotpoints
1. Malthusian Poverty Trap.
2. UK's Industrial Revolution: Rise of UK GDP and standards of living.
3. Spread to Europe: The rising interconnectedness of the whole of Europe correlates with mainland European countries' catching up with UK in terms of economic activities. Example: development of the railroad system. 
4. The Great Divergence: The rest of the world lagged behind while Europe and western offshoots quickly developed, leading to the world inequality today. 
5. Call to action: Stand against deglobalisation, support free flow of human and physical capital across national borders.

## Data
### Maddision Project
[Statistics on World Population, GDP and Per Capita GDP, 1-2008 AD](http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/oriindex.htm)

> "The Maddison Project, also known as the Maddison Historical Statistics Project, is a project to collate historical economic statistics, such as GDP, GDP per capita, and labor productivity. It was launched in March 2010 to continue the work of the late economic historian Angus Maddison. The project is under the Groningen Growth and Development Centre at the University of Groningen, which also hosts the Penn World Table, another economic statistics project." - [Wikipedia: Maddison Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maddison_Project)

This is my main source of data. The Maddison dataset is a very popular and well-respected dataset in developmental economics. I will use the raw dataset to visualise:
- World GDP per capita 1-2008 AD (by calculating world average GDP per capita in a given year)
- UK's industrial revolution (by graphing UK's GDP per capita across time)
- Industrial revolution in Europe (by graphing GDP per capita in selected European countries around the time of the industrial revolutions, including UK)
- The Great Divergence (by graphing GDP per capital in selected countries around the world during and after the industrial revolutions, including UK)

### Fordham University's Internet Modern History Sourcebook

> "The Internet Modern History Sourcebook is one of series of history primary sourcebooks. It is intended to serve the needs of teachers and students in college survey courses in modern European history and American history, as well as in  modern Western Civilization and World Cultures. Although this part of the Internet History Sourcebooks Project began as a way to access texts that were already available on the Internet, it now contains hundreds of texts made available locally." - [Paul Halsall: Introduction, Internet Modern History Sourcebook](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/modsbook.asp#Introduction)

[Tables Illustrating the Spread of Industrialization](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/indrevtabs1.asp)

[Spread of Railways in 19th Century](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/INDREV6.asp)

I will use the railroad information in the table (linked above) to visualise:
- The interconnectidedness of Europe across the period during industrial revolutions. The spread of railway in a country should positively correlates with its stage in industrial revolution as well as GDP per capita.

These economics essays will give me a framwork for my story of the industrial revolutions and the great divergence. The empirical data, analysis of the economic history, and the economics theory will go into the write up of my project. Some of the numbers reported or calculated in the essays might be used in smaller/simpler visualisations to support the story arc. I will decide which data to visualise as I move forward in this project. 

# Method and Medium
I will use Shorthand. The final project will be a story with both description and data visualisation intertwined with each other presented as a digital story that can be accessed online. This style might be similar to Delloite's [Balancing the Books:
IFRS 16 and Aviation Finance](http://www.euromoneythoughtleadership.com/aviation-IFRS16/).
