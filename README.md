This is Esther Tan's portfolio for Telling Stories with Data. 

# About Me
My name is Esther Tan (she/her). Currently, I am studying at Carnegie Mellon University in the Master of Entertainment Industry program, and I am pursuing a career in market research in the entertainment industry. With a MSc Economics degree, I am eager to utilize my economic knowledge and empirical skillset in better serving creative businesses. Good stories are the foundations of my wildest dreams, and I hope to share these stories to inspire others as they once inspired me. 

# What I Hope to Learn
I am very excited to take this Telling Stories with Data class. I believe that business decisions should always be well-informed and data-driven, and the rational mind is surprisingly powerful in the creative industry. While I am profecient in statistical analysis to interpret data to form compelling stories, I am less confident in my ability to accurately present my ideas. In this class, I wish to 

1. Know why some data visualization work and some don't. 
2. Broaden the variety of my data visualizations (economists are obssessed with bar chart and scatterplot and so am I).
3. Balance aesthetic with scientific accuracy.
