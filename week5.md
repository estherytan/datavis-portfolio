## Creation of a user research protocol and completion of interviews
1. Target audience

Any intellectual with an interest in global economy or global politics. Because of the limitation of this project, I am choosing to target international students in universities especially. They are a typical subgroup of my broader target audience. They are more likely to care about globalisation and the free flow of capital across national borders. This project gives them some theoretical and empirical backing, encouraging them to embrace their roles as bridges across countries and support freedom of movement. 

2. Identifying representative individuals to interview

Since I am an international student myself, I know a fair amount of international students with various backgrounds. I have selected three of my friends who are close enough to give me honest feedback. The three participants have the following academic and geographical backgrounds:

- Master Student, Design, School of Visual Arts, New York, US

- Master Student, Information System Management, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, US

- Master Student, Chemistry, Durham University, Durham, UK

The design student can give me perspectives on visual aspects, the chemistry student can give me perspectives on data analytics, and the MISM student is also in the Telling Stories with Data class, so we can talk about the specifics of data visualisation covered in this class. The interviews are conducted in Mandarin and/or English. 

3. Interview script

The questions I prepared are:

- Have a quick glance through the article. What is the story I'm trying to tell? Please retell it to me.

- Now please look at each of the data visualisations. What do you think I am trying to accomplish with those graphs? Are any of them confusing to you?

I will tell them the story I am planning to tell in this article, and what each data visualisation is for. 

- How do you suggest that I can improve? 

Generally I haven't planned a lot of questions beforehand, but rather relying on going deeper on their feedbacks as well as bouncing new ideas of them. 

4. Findings from interviews

- Master Student, Design, XXX, New York, US

In general she liked the wireframe. According to her, the central idea was relatively clear. For the first graph, the only thing she didn't understand is why the three segments are fragmented. (It was due to the lack of data pre 1850 and Tableau's grouping function when I tried to change the color of the segments.) 

However, she didn't like the last visualisation "The Great Divergence". There were too many colors in one graph and she wasn't sure what I wanted to say with this graph. She suggested that I grouped the countried into "Western Europe and Western Offshoots" and "The Rest of the World", since the former one rode the wave of the industrial revolution and the second group missed out, and these are the two groups I was trying to compare. 

Furthermore, she suggested that I use a realistic and simple aesthetic. Economics doesn't need flashy colors of graphics. My topic is also quite a serious one. In generaly, she suggested a theme of blue for my article. For the accompanying pictures, she suggested historical photos and minimal use of animated images. 

- Master Student, Information System Management, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, US

As a fellow student in the Telling Stories with Data class, her suggestion was more technically focused. For the first visualisation, she felt that the World GDP isn't needed. The current graph is misleading as World GDP and UK GDP have the same shape but are not on the same scale (UK GDP is way higher than world average). 

For the second visualisation, she suggested I use a short animation to show the changes across time. Shorthand offers a functions to scroll across image, which could be used to do the animation. The current design is a bit confusing because the graph is too long to fit in the computer screen, so when she scrolled down she couldn't see the top of the graph. But overall she was impressed by this visualisation. 

The third visualisation remains to be a problem. There were too many colours. She suggested to use more grouping, less colour, and duller colours as opposed to brighter ones. She also felt that the ending was too abrupt, and that I should have a summary. 

- Master Student, Chemistry, Durham University, Durham, UK

As a chemistry student, she mainly focused on the internal logic of my article and the truthful representation of data. She also felt that world GDP isn't needed, because it doesn't fit in with the arc of the story. We agreed that the structure of the story should be UK-Europe-World, which is increasing in scope. 

For the second graph, she felt that it was fine once she spent sometime reading it. But at first she didn't know where to too at and in which direction she should process (e.g. should I read horizontally first or vertically first?). She felt that more instruction should be provided in reading this graph. 

She was simiarlly confused about the third graph. Comments made were similar to the ones described above. Overall, their confusion about this visualisation surprised me, because I have an economics background and I know this is a very well known visualisation of the Great Divergence, which is also a famous viewpoint in economics. I kind of forgot not all people have the same background as I do, and that they are not familiar with the concept itself. 

5. Changes implemented

After careful consideration, I implemented these changes:

- Changed the main title of the article to make my overall story structure and main viewpoint clearer. 

- Added opening photo slide show to draw people in.

- Deleted the World GDP visualisation. 

- Indicated spaces for images. 

- Divided story by chapters to indicate logical flow. 

- Redo the GDP & Rail & Import Export graph as an animation. (The animation is indicated here by a video frame, but I am planning to use animation while scrolling on Shorthand, which will be a full screen animation).

- Added two correlation coefficients between GDP per capita & Railway Milage and GDP per capita & International Trade per capita. 

- Divided countries into two subgroups for the Great Divergene graph to reduce the colours.

- Changed the title of the Great Divergence graph to better suggest the main idea of the data visualisation. 

- Added another animation (same style as the one before) to reinforce the increasing global inequality as a result of the Great Divergence. 

- Changed the last part of the story to a summary. Added a word cloud to indicate the importance of Glibalisation & Deglibalisation and that people are putting more and more focus on the topic. 

- Added "share" button as a clear call to action.
