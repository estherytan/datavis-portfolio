## Creation of a user research protocol and completion of at least three interviews
1. Target audience
Any intellectual with an interest in global economy or global politics. Because of the limitation of this project, I am choosing to target international students in universities especially. They are a typical subgroup of my broader target audience. They are more likely to care about globalisation and the free flow of capital across national borders. This project gives them some theoretical and empirical backing, encouraging them to embrace their roles as bridges across countries and support freedom of movement. 

2. Identifying representative individuals to interview
Since I am an international student myself, I know a fair amount of international students with various backgrounds. I have selected three of my friends who are close enough to give me honest feedback. The three participants have the following academic and geographical backgrounds:

- Master Student, Design, XXX, New York, US

- Master Student, Information System Management, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, US

- Master Student, Chemistry, Durham University, Durham, UK

The design student can give me perspectives on visual aspects, the chemistry student can give me perspectives on data analytics, and the MISM student is also in the Telling Stories with Data class, so we can talk about the specifics of data visualisation covered in this class. 

3. Interview script
