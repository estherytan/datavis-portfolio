## Creation of a user research protocol and completion of interviews
1. Target audience

Any intellectual with an interest in global economy or global politics. Because of the limitation of this project, I am choosing to target international students in universities especially. They are a typical subgroup of my broader target audience. They are more likely to care about globalisation and the free flow of capital across national borders. This project gives them some theoretical and empirical backing, encouraging them to embrace their roles as bridges across countries and support freedom of movement. 

2. Identifying representative individuals to interview

Since I am an international student myself, I know a fair amount of international students with various backgrounds. I have selected three of my friends who are close enough to give me honest feedback. The three participants have the following academic and geographical backgrounds:

- Master Student, Design, School of Visual Arts, New York, US

- Master Student, Information System Management, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, US

- Master Student, Chemistry, Durham University, Durham, UK

The design student can give me perspectives on visual aspects, the chemistry student can give me perspectives on data analytics, and the MISM student is also in the Telling Stories with Data class, so we can talk about the specifics of data visualisation covered in this class. The interviews are conducted in Mandarin and/or English. 

3. Interview script

The questions I prepared are:

- Have a quick glance through the article. What is the story I'm trying to tell? Please retell it to me.

- Now please look at each of the data visualisations. What do you think I am trying to accomplish with those graphs? Are any of them confusing to you?

I will tell them the story I am planning to tell in this article, and what each data visualisation is for. 

- How do you suggest that I can improve? 

Generally I haven't planned a lot of questions beforehand, but rather relying on going deeper on their feedbacks as well as bouncing new ideas of them. 

4. Findings from interviews

- Master Student, Design, XXX, New York, US

In general she liked the wireframe. According to her, the central idea was relatively clear. For the first graph, the only thing she didn't understand is why the three segments are fragmented. (It was due to the lack of data pre 1850 and Tableau's grouping function when I tried to change the color of the segments.) 

However, she didn't like the last visualisation "The Great Divergence". There were too many colors in one graph and she wasn't sure what I wanted to say with this graph. She suggested that I grouped the countried into "Western Europe and Western Offshoots" and "The Rest of the World", since the former one rode the wave of the industrial revolution and the second group missed out, and these are the two groups I was trying to compare. 

Furthermore, she suggested that I use a realistic and simple aesthetic. Economics doesn't need flashy colors of graphics. My topic is also quite a serious one. In generaly, she suggested a theme of blue for my article. For the accompanying pictures, she suggested historical photos and minimal use of animated images.
