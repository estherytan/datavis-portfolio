## Creation of a user research protocol and completion of at least three interviews
1. Target audience

Any intellectual with an interest in global economy or global politics. Because of the limitation of this project, I am choosing to target international students in universities especially. They are a typical subgroup of my broader target audience. They are more likely to care about globalisation and the free flow of capital across national borders. This project gives them some theoretical and empirical backing, encouraging them to embrace their roles as bridges across countries and support freedom of movement. 

2. Identifying representative individuals to interview

Since I am an international student myself, I know a fair amount of international students with various backgrounds. I have selected three of my friends who are close enough to give me honest feedback. The three participants have the following academic and geographical backgrounds:

- Master Student, Design, XXX, New York, US

- Master Student, Information System Management, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, US

- Master Student, Chemistry, Durham University, Durham, UK

The design student can give me perspectives on visual aspects, the chemistry student can give me perspectives on data analytics, and the MISM student is also in the Telling Stories with Data class, so we can talk about the specifics of data visualisation covered in this class. The interviews are conducted in Mandarin and/or English. 

3. Interview script

The questions I prepared are:

- Have a quick glance through the article. What is the story I'm trying to tell? Please retell it to me.

- Now please look at each of the data visualisations. What do you think I am trying to accomplish with those graphs? Are any of them confusing to you?

I will tell them the story I am planning to tell in this article, and what each data visualisation is for. 

- How do you suggest that I can improve? 

Generally I haven't planned a lot of questions beforehand, but rather relying on going deeper on their feedbacks as well as bouncing new ideas of them. 

4. Findings from interviews

- Master Student, Design, XXX, New York, US



- Master Student, Information System Management, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, US

- Master Student, Chemistry, Durham University, Durham, UK

5. Changes implemented
