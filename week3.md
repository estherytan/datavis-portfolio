# Week 3 Assignment
Data and information source: [OECD iLibrary: Health at a Glance 2017](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/health_glance-2017-5-en/index.html?itemId=/content/component/health_glance-2017-5-en). 

Chapter Two, Figure 2.3 Life expectancy gains associated with a 10% change in the main determinants of health. 

This data visualisation was selected because of the easy public access of the original data, as well as its potential for redesign. 

# Original Data Visualisation Critique
What worked well: Useful and Truthful. 

- The over all aesthetic is pretty good. The blue is consistent with the overall design of the health report, and of the OECD website. The graph is simple-ish and doesn't push people away from going into more detail. 
- It doesn't elicit emotional response, but I think that is a good thing, because this report is supposed to be professional and unbiased. Health is also a very serious issue. Plus, this is a report in academia, not in business or news, which means it's intended for academics and/or policy makers. Too much emotion makes the graph amateur and unprofessional by the academic standard. 
- Very useful and accurate presentation of data for academics and policy makers. It pretty much covers all major determinants of health. The form of a bar chart is also very frequently used in these contexts and easily understood by the intended audience. No break in axis or misrepresented bar length. Fair comparison between data points. 

What didn't work well: Perceptibility and Intuitiveness are low. 

- There is no explanation as to why bars are group into different colour (no instructions in the graph or in the article), and it's not an intuitive grouping either. My GUESS is that the author put the main determinants into classes such as health spending, lifestyle, social factors... but the only hint is in the abstract of the article, which is pretty far from the graph. 
- The choice of different shades of blue suggests that the groups have some sort of measurable hierarchy (bigger-smaller, higher-lower, etc), while in reality they are just different groups. 
- The arrows on y axis have intuitive meanings, but looks "busy" on the graph. There are simpler ways to incorporate the information. 
- The dots doesn't have intuitive meanings. There is an explanation at the bottom of the graph, but I don't think dots actually are needed to indicate near zero influence. 
- Unnecessary stylisation and repeated information overall. 

What I would do differently:

- Change the colours of the bars to different colours completely. Add legend explaining what each colour means. 
- Take out the arrows on the y axis. Flip the bars for smoking and alcohol to the left to indicate negative value. 
- Take out the dots. 
- Add a subtitle to the graph to indicate the story this graph is trying to tell.
